# useful_Python_Snippets
A repo of small Python3 code snippets that do one specific thing each

The idea of this repository is to collect and share small Python3 programs that each perform a simple function to help developers

For example the first couple of snippets convert colour codes between Hex codes and RGB codes.

When adding snippets please include a comment to describe what the snippet does
